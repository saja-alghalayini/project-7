<h1>The Undoing Project (Michael Lewis)</h1>
When working with numbers, the facts rarely lie. Yet if we turn to intuition and emotional responses, we are often steered in the wrong direction. 

The Undoing Project follows the groundbreaking research of two psychologists who coined the term “behavioral economics.” It all leads to the use of big data and evidence-based algorithms over our intuitive responses. 

In this book, you`ll learn how to filter through your feelings when working with figures and how to use data to support your decisions.

<h1>Thinking, Fast and Slow (Daniel Kahneman)</h1>
As a Nobel Prize in Economics recipient, Kahneman is certainly a thought leader in the industry. His book “Thinking, Fast and Slow” is a winner of the National Academy of Sciences Best Book Award. 

Discover the two main systems of thought and how to decipher between the two. Building on the concept in The Undoing Project, this book discusses the benefits of thinking slow. 

From an accounting perspective, this knowledge will inspire you to work more judiciously to reduce mistakes.
