Cybersecurity analysts protect organizational infrastructure, such as computer networks and hardware devices, from cybercriminals and hackers seeking to cause damage or steal sensitive information.<br /> 

Hospital engineers are professionals whose recognition is usually not related to their importance in clinical management. These professionals play a key role in achieving centres that are more sustainable and adapted to the new social and health realities..
<br/>
<h4>â€œThe work of hospital engineers is essential to introduce new technologies and materials in hospitals.

<h2>What is Hospital Engineering?</h2>
Hospital Engineering is a branch of health that is oriented towards the management, planning, analysis, design, development and implementation of technologies that offer alternatives and improved solutions to the problems of the hospital environment. How? Using the latest technologies, especially in the health sector.

The modernization of the hospital sector is a palpable reality of the last decades that, in this case, has generated the need for engineers specialized in medical equipment and sanitary facilities.

This hospital engineering related long ago to the mere maintenance and good use of hospital buildings, facilities and equipment, today it is already an obsolete concept. In fact, it is one of the professions that are evolving the most and that will evolve the most.

 

<h2 >How can engineering help health?</h2>
Modern medicine and healthcare rely heavily on engineering to deliver improved prevention, diagnosis and treatment of illness. These technologies are vital to the delivery of efficient health services through the National Health Service (NHS).
 <br />


<h2> Why is engineering important for public health?</h2>
Public health engineering can play an important and significant role in solving environmental health issues. In order to confront public health challenges emerging out of environmental problems we need adequately trained public health engineers / environmental engineers.
